🦀 Learn Rust – My Journey to Rust Mastery

This repository is a collection of projects, experiments, and examples from my journey to becoming an expert in Rust.
I aim to explore all aspects of Rust — from basic syntax to advanced topics — with a strong focus on:

High-performance APIs (REST, gRPC, GraphQL)

Networking (custom TCP/UDP servers, protocol design, WebSockets, zero-copy data)

Async & Concurrency with tokio, async/await, and parallel processing

Systems programming and low-level memory management

Compiler insights and optimizations

Performance tuning and benchmarking

Safe & efficient code patterns leveraging Rust’s ownership model

Cross-platform development targeting Linux, Windows, and WebAssembly
