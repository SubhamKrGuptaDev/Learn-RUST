# 🦀 Learn Rust

## 🚀 My Journey to Rust Mastery

This repository is a collection of **projects, experiments, and examples** from my journey to becoming an **expert in Rust**.  
I aim to explore all aspects of Rust — from **basic syntax** to **advanced topics** — with a strong focus on:

- ⚡ High-performance APIs (REST, gRPC, GraphQL)
- 🌐 Networking (custom TCP/UDP servers, protocol design, WebSockets, zero-copy data)
- ⏳ Async & Concurrency with `tokio`, `async/await`, and parallel processing
- 🖥️ Systems programming and low-level memory management
- 🏗️ Compiler insights and optimizations
- 📊 Performance tuning and benchmarking
- 🔒 Safe & efficient code patterns leveraging Rust’s ownership model
- 🛠️ Cross-platform development (Linux, Windows, WebAssembly)

## 📚 Contents

### 🚀 Basics & Syntax

- Variables, ownership, borrowing, lifetimes
- Structs, enums, pattern matching
- Traits, generics, modules, error handling

### 🌐 APIs & Networking

- Building REST APIs with **Axum**
- Asynchronous server handling with `tokio`
- WebSocket communication
- Writing custom TCP/UDP servers
- Experimenting with zero-copy networking

### ⚡ Advanced Rust

- Unsafe Rust (when and how to use it)
- Compiler-level optimizations
- Memory layout & profiling
- Async performance tuning
- Creating custom crates and libraries

---

## 🎯 Goal

To **master Rust** by building **real-world, performance-oriented projects** while understanding how Rust compiles and optimizes code.  
From high-level APIs to low-level systems programming, this repo will cover **all areas where Rust shines**.
